The python codes for the Analyzing Neural Time Series Data, Mike X Cohen (2012) MIT Press This is the code that accompanies the book. https://www.amazon.com/Analyzing-Neural-Time-Data-Practice/dp/0262019876

## Summary:
Analyzing Neural Time Series Data by Mike X Cohen is an extremely educational book to teach you the conceptual, mathematical, and implementational (but sadly only via Matlab programming) bases of time-, time-frequency-, and synchonization-based analyses of MEG, EEG, and LFP recordings from humans and nonhuman animals.

Despite of being a perfect textbook, some might think you prefer Python codes rather than expensive MATLAB language.
