# AnalyzingNeuralTimeSeries_Python_Implimentation
The python codes for the Analyzing Neural Time Series Data, Mike X Cohen (2012) MIT Press This is the code that accompanies the book. https://www.amazon.com/Analyzing-Neural-Time-Data-Practice/dp/0262019876

## The original MATLAB codes by Cohen

## Sample Neural Data
.mat file, in their native format, are difficut to handle in languages other than MATLAB. To facilitate easier handling with Python's MNE-Python, we converted the original .mat format EEG data into the .vhdr format (Brain Vision)--which is common and readable EEG format for MNE.

## Summary:
Analyzing Neural Time Series Data by Mike X Cohen is an extremely educational book to teach you the conceptual, mathematical, and implementational (but sadly only via Matlab programming) bases of time-, time-frequency-, and synchonization-based analyses of MEG, EEG, and LFP recordings from humans and nonhuman animals.

Despite of being a perfect textbook, some might have some difficulties in implementation as it only supports MATLAB--insanely expensive language. Here, I aim to put the available MATLAB code in Python.

Feel free to use my codes to help your study!!
